The complexity and overlaps in the regulation and quality assurance systems need to be addressed.
Structural and systemic issues: Mobility within the education system should be supported through clear standards and procedures. Students should be able to move between colleges and universities, between different universities, between schools and post-school institutions, and between educational provision and the world of work. To do this, they need information on what different institutions offer.
Each post-school institution must have a clear identity and mission, including further education and training colleges. FET colleges continueto offer traditional theoretical training for apprenticeships through the old formal technical college instructional programmes popularly known as Nated programmes and the National CertiÔ¨Åcate Vocational. Delivering these programmes in a single institution is difficult and can be confusing.
There should be programmes to upgrade the skills of college lecturers, in partnership with industry. Industry experts should be encouraged and incentivised to spend time teaching in colleges, and college lecturers should be encouraged to spend time in the workplace updatingtheir knowledge and skills. College teaching should be made attractive to good lecturers and students.
The evolution of the post-school system should always be guided by the principle of providing learning opportunities for all students.
Drivers of change: Private and public institutions mustworktogetherto create the educational infrastructure needed to support a thriving economy. The globalisation of labour and technology markets requires education systems to collaborate across national borders and across sectors.
