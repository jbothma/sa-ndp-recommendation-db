By 2030, South Africans should have access to education and training of the highest quality, leading to signiﬁcantly improved learning outcomes.
The performance of South African learners in international standardised tests should be comparable to the performance of learners from countries at a similar level of development and with similar levels of access.
Education should be compulsory up to Grade l2 or equivalent levels in vocational education and training.
The education, training and innovation system should cater for different needs and produce highly skilled individuals. The graduates of South Africa's universities and colleges should have the skills and knowledge to meet the present and future needs of the economy and society.
Innovation is critical for introducing new products into the market and producing goods and services more efficiently. Research and development should be signiﬁcantly expanded. Collaboration across the South African education system and with internationally accredited institutions should lead to higher levels of innovation.
The education system will play a greater role in building an inclusive society, providing equal opportunities and helping all South Africans to realise their full potential, in particular those previously disadvantaged by apartheid policies, namely black people, women and people with disabilities.
The different parts of the education system should work together allowing learners to take different pathways that offer high quality learning opportunities. There should be clear linkages between schools, FET colleges, universities of technology, universities and other providers of education and training. There should also be clear linkages between education and training and the world ofwork.
