Identify an appropriate role for distance education in the college sector and develop a policy framework to guide institutions in developing distance education.
The existing programmes and qualiÔ¨Åcations for adult learners should be restructured to ensure they are appropriate for their target audience. The proposed Community Education and Training Centres will help expand opportunities for graduates of the adult literacy campaign as well as other adult learners. The location of the literacy campaign and the adult basic education and training programme in different departments is not ideal. Linkages need to be developed to ensure that learners who graduate from one programme do not face barriers in advancingtheir studies in another programme.
