Improving the performance of the South African

education system requires hard work and focus.

The Commission proposes that specific focus over
the next I 8 years should be on:

0 Improving literacy, numeracy/mathematics
and science outcomes

Increasing the number of learners eligible to
study maths and science—based degrees at
university

Improving performance in international
comparative studies

Retaining more learners.

These goals will require improvements in other
areas as well and will impact on the education

system as whole.

Improve literacy, numeracy/mathematics
and science outcomes

The Department of Basic Education aims to
increase to 90 percent the number of learners in
grades 3, 6 and 9 who have mastered the minimum
competencies in language and numeracy by the end
of each year. The Commission proposes that the
required competency levels be defined as
50 percent and above. In other words, 90 percent
of learners in grades 3, 6 and 9 must achieve
50 percent or more in the annual national

assessments in these subjects.

Increase the number of students eligible

to study maths and science at university

In 20| I, I20 767 learners were eligible for a
bachelor's programme, down from I26 37| in
20 I 0. The Department of Basic Education's plan is
to increase the number to 300 000 by 2024, with
350 000 learners passing mathematics and 320 000
learners passing physical science. The Commission
proposes a target for 2030 of 450 000 learners

being eligible for a bachelor's programme with

maths and science. Action is required throughout
the education system, but particularly in early
childhood development given that the cohort that
will enter university in 2030 has not yet started
primary school. Consideration should be given to
expanding the Dinaledi Schools initiative, which
increases access to maths and science in

underprivileged schools.

Improve performance in international
comparative studies

The Department of Basic Education aims to
improve South Africa's average Southern and East
African Consortium for Monitoring Education
Quality results for grade 6 languages and maths
from 495 to 600 points by 2022. And to improve
average grade 8 scores in the Trends in
Mathematics and Science Study CTIMSS) from 264
to 420 points by 2023. The Commission proposes
that grade 8 scores in the round ofTIMSS closest to
2030 should reach 500 points.

South Africa needs to develop and strengthen
collaboration with other education systems in the
English—speaking world and the BRIC countries
(Brazil, Russia, India and China) to ensure that
students from the South African education system
are equipped to be admitted into those systems.
International collaboration in education will help
South Africa to successfully tacl<le its education
challenges. Stronger educational links with these
countries will also help students to become
increasingly broadminded in terms of how they

look at both South Africa and the widerworld.

Retain more learners

South Africa loses half of every cohort that enters
the school system by the end of the I2—year
schooling period, wasting significant human
potential and harming the life—chances of many
young people. Secondary school completion rates

are 77 percent in the United States, 87 percent (to
