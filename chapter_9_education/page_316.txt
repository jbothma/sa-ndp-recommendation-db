The Department of Basic Education has guidelines for planning public school infrastructure. These guidelines classify primary and secondary schools into four categories based on the number of learners: small, medium, large and mega schools. The school environment is further graded according to basic safety, minimum functionality, optimum functionality and possibilities for enrichment. The guidelines are sound and should be legislated to ensure that they are adhered to. Legislated guidelines will help to ensure they are not deliberately ignored by officials involved in planning, constructing and improving school infrastructure.
Eradicate infrastructure backlogs. All schools should meetthe minimum standards by 20I6.
Undertake an infrastructure audit to enable proper planning. By 2030, all schools should have high quality infrastructure.
Investigate the spiralling costs of building schools. See Building a Capable and Developmental State.
Develop measures to build schools at a reasonable cost without compromising quality. Expand infrastructure delivery capacity.
To avoid construction delays clarify and streamline the responsibilities of different institutions including the Departments of Basic Education and Public Works, the Independent Development Trust, provincial departments of education, and local authorities.
Reverse the decision to centralise the delivery of school infrastructure and develop capacity at the appropriate levels. Procurement decision making should remain decentralised but there's a central role in providing enabling structures (in this case guidelines on price, materials and construction firms) as well as differentiated oversight.
Plan new schools according to population trends and settlement patterns to avoid constructing schools where demand is declining. This will require closer coordination with local authorities.
The Department of Basic Education, Department of Communications, Department of Public Enterprises and INFRACO must draw up ajoint plan to roll out broadband ICT infrastructure to schools. ICT will play an increasing role in education over the next I 8 years, and the most crucial enabler of ICT is highâ€”speed broadband. Corporate foundations, NGOs and international donors should be invited to work with the government to develop open source educational software and content.
