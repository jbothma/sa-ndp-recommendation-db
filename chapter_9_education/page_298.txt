CHAPTER NINE

KEY POINTS

The South African education system needs
urgent action. Building national capabilities
requires quality early childhood
development, basic education, further and

higher education.

Early childhood development should be
broadly defined, taking into account all the
development needs of a child, and provided

to all children.

The priorities in basic education are human
capacity, school management, district
support, infrastructure and results-oriented
mutual accountability between schools and

communities.

Further Education and Training colleges,
public adult learning centres, sector
education and training authorities,
professional colleges and Community

Education and Training Centres are

Improving
education,
training and
innovation

important elements of the post-school
system that provide diverse learning

opportunities.

Further education should expand
moderately, and as quality improves/expands
rapidly, higher education should incorporate
a range of different institutions that work
together to serve different priorities,
including effective regulatory and advisory

institutions.

Distance education, aided by advanced
information communication technology, will
play a greater role in expanding learning
opportunities for different groups of learners
and promote lifelong learning and continuous
professional development. Private providers
will continue to be important partners in the

delivery of education and training at all levels.

Research and innovation by universities,
science councils, departments, NGOs and
the private sector has a key role to play in
improving South Africaâ€™s global
competitiveness. Coordination between the

different role-payers is important.
