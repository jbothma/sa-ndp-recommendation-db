Teachers should be recognised for their efforts and professionalism. Teaching should be a highly valued profession.
Attention should be given to the continuing development of teachers and promotion of professional standards. Bodies such as the South African Council for Educators and specialist subject associations need to play a greater role in this. Teachers must have a good knowledge of the subjects they teach and cognitive competence in the language in which they are required to teach. Subject knowledge particularly needs strengthening in maths and science.
The best teachers should be retained and new ones attracted. Bursary programmes for continuing professional development can improve the quality of teaching and help to attract and retain teachers. The pay structure for teachers should encourage them to stay in the profession.
The core business of schools is learning and teaching, and the core task of principals is to ensure their school ethos is conducive to these priorities. Principals need to provide leadership on the curriculum, as well as administration and management.
Teaching in schools can be improved through targeted support by district offices. District offices should also ensure communication and information sharing between the education authorities and schools, and also between schools.
Top performing schools in the public and private sectors must be recognised as national assets. They should be supported and not saddled with unnecessary burdens. Theirsupport should be enlisted to assist underperforming schools. To remain the beacons of our education system, they need to be supported as well as held accountable for performance based on an agreed set of outcomes.
Providing meaningful information to parents on their children's performance can enable them to hold schools accountable. Performance tends to improve when parents are actively involved and take an interest in the affairs of the school.
Ensure that all schools meet minimum standards for infrastructure and commit to progres— sively upgrading each school's infrastructure to meet optimum standards.
Target no—fee schoo when planning infrastructure compensate for resource deficits in com ties. There should be well—equipped librarie , laboratories, computer and media centres to ensure that learners in no—fee schools have access to similar learning resources to their counterparts in less poor communities.
Take learner safety into account when planning infrastructure.
High speed broadband should be readily available and incorporated into the design of schools. This will enable greater use of technology in education and enhance the classroom experience for both teachers and students.
Explore the use of mobile devices such as phones and tablets in distributing learning content.
