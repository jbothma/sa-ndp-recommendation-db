Proposals to improve school infrastructure: School infrastructure backlogs have been considerably reduced over the past IO years. But many school environments are still not conducive to learning.
Find ways to deliver infrastructure and services more efﬁciently and cost-effectively.
Improve the quality of infomation used for planning.
In addition to suitable buildings, schools need access to services such as water, sanitation and electricity. The rollout of infrastructure for these services is bedevilled by poor coordination between different state agencies and local authorities, who are responsible for providing infrastructure services.
Infrastructure shortages are particularly acute in poor communities where learners are at a signiﬁcant disadvantage. The no-fee school policy and school nutrition programme are important interventions to mitigate the negative effects of poverty on learning.
In many rural areas schools are the only public institution communities have access to. No-fee schools are typically located in areas with low levels of education, fragile social networks, largely dysfunctional community structures, no community libraries, limited access to media, and few sources of information about opportunities. Schools in these communities should be strengthened and equipped with the best infrastructure, equipment and resources (especially ICT infrastructure) to strengthen their role in countering historical disadvantage. No—fee schools should be targeted for significant infrastructure upgrading.
