The state is responsible for ensuring that all vulnerable families receive a comprehensive package of early childhood development services. There should be a policy and programme shift to ensure that the Department of Basic Education takes the core responsibility for the provision and monitoring of ECD. Other departments should continue to provide services in a supportive capacity. Resource allocation should gradually reï¬‚ect the changes in institutional responsibility for early childhood development.
The interests of all stakeholders should be aligned to support the common goal of achieving good educational outcomes that are responsive to community needs and economic development.
0 Educational institutions should be provided with the capacity to implement policy. Where capacity is lacking, this should be addressed as an urgent priority.
