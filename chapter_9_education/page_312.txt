achieving candidates into teaching. The flat wage
gradient is a deterrent for highly skilled people.
Teacher salaries need to be competitive in
comparison to other parts of the public sector. The
wage structure should recognise qualifications,
experience and the scarcity of skills in specific

subjects or geographic areas.

0 Link the pay structure to career paths and

reward good teachers.

Improving performance

Many education experts are critical of the idea of
inl<ing teacher pay to the performance of learners
3ecause it ignores other factors affecting learner
Derformance, such as the socioeconomic status of
earners, parent involvement, learning bacl<logs,
and school infrastructure and resources. Teachers in
DOOI’ areas would be penalised forfactors they have

no control over, and teachers in rich schools would

 

3e more likely to benefit. The Commission
therefore proposes that incentives be directed at
schools ratherthan at individual teachers to focus on
those areas where teachers worl<ing collectively

can make a difference.

0 Reward schools that show continuous
improvements in their annual national
assessments. To target incentives at where
they are most needed, design the incentives to
prescribe that schools should improve their
results by IO percent or more to qualify. Many
of the schools in afﬂuent areas are already
performing at high level with pass rates above
80 percent and are unlikely to improve their

results by IO percent.

0 Ensure that improvements are sustainable by
prescribing that schools must show
improvement over three consecutive years to

qualify for rewards.

0 Maintain acareful balance between making the
conditions too difficult so that it is not
worthwhileforschoolstoworl<towardsthem,
or so easy that they make no difference to

performance.

Proposals for improving school
management

The core business of schools is learning and
teaching. The main responsibility of a school
principal should be to lead the core business ofthe

school.

Appropriately qualiﬁed and competent
principals

0 Change the appointment process to ensure
that competent individuals are attracted to become
school principals. As in other senior management
positions, candidates should undergo a
competency assessment to determine their
suitability and identify the areas in which they would

need development and support.

0 Eliminate union influence in promoting or
appointing principals. Unions play an important role
in recruitment to ensure that proper procedures
are followed, but not in deciding who gets
promoted or appointed. Most of the undue
influence by unions is possible because the district
officials responsible for recruitment and human
resources management have a limited
understanding of labour laws. The Department of
Basic Education and provincial departments of
education must ensure that human resources

management capacity is improved.

0 Implement an entry qualification for principals.
In 2007, the Department of Education introduced
an entry qualification for aspiring principals with a

view to improving educational outcomes. The

Advanced Certificate in Education (ACE) was
