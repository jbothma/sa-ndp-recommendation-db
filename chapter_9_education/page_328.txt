Funding for higher education as a proportion of GDP has declined marginally overthe last few years from 0.76 percent in 2000 to 0.69 percent in 2009. To preserve the quality of higher education, additional funding will be needed to support an increase in participation and knowledge production.
Base the revisions to the universities’ funding framework that is currently being considered by the Ministerial Committee for the Review of the Funding of Universities on the needs of a differentiated system, with adequate provision for both teaching and research.
As the quality assurance and monitoring system matures, greater emphasis should be placed on incentivising graduate output. Such a shift would be in line with the international trend towards greater emphasis on output—based funding. The Department of Higher Education and Training would have to address the risk of discouraging universities from taking students from deprived backgrounds.
Provide all students who qualify for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme with access to full funding through loans and bursaries to cover the costs of tuition, books, accommodation and other living expenses. Students who do not qualify should have access to bank loans, backed by state su reties. Both the National Student Financial Aid Scheme and bank loans should be recovered through arrangements with the South African Revenue Service. Service—linked scholarships should be available in areas such as nursing, teaching and social work.
Consider extending the National Student Financial Aid Scheme to qualifying students in registered private colleges as an incentive for private sector expansion.
The Department of Higher Education and Training should identify institutions that are in ongoing crisis despite earlier interventions. Dedicated support should be provided for comprehensive renewal plans over five years. The plans should identify a viable and sustainable academic path for the institution, with an appropriate programme and qualification mix. If measurable progress towards achieving the objectives is not evident after five years, consideration should be given to reviewing the status ofthe institution.
