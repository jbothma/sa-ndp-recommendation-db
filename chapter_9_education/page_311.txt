Expose teachers to the use of technology in their own training, and train them to use it in their teaching. Greater use of technology backed by high-speed broadband could open new opportunities not currently available for learners in disadvantaged schools.
Investigate introducing professional certiﬁcation. Newly qualiﬁed teachers would need to demonstrate certain competencies before they are employed in schools, and after that they would be offered preliminary or probationary certiﬁcation, to be finalised based on demonstrated competence. The professional certiﬁcation of all teachers would need to be renewed periodically (for example, every ﬁve years), serving as an incentive for teachers to undertake continuous professional development.
Professional associations: Allow a wide range of training providers to offer professional development courses for teachers, subject to approval by the South African Council for Educators.
Support professional associations working more closely with teachers to provide professional development opportunities, disseminate information about best practices and provide updates on cutting-edge research in particular school subject areas. In subject areas where professional associations do not exist, provide incentives to stimulate their establishment.
Teacher unions: Teacher unions are crucial to improving the education system. Experience in other countries shows that without a good level of professional expertise among union leaders, it is difficult to get unions to move beyond the issue of salary increments to the core professional concern of improving the quality of education.
Investigate ways of working with unions to reach their members.
Sponsor advanced studies for union leaders as part of a constructive partnership.
Assist unions in developing the capacity to implement continuous professional development strategies for their members. Over time, accredit professional development institutes linked to unions so that they can offer continuous professional development that earns points towards meeting the Continuing Professional Teacher Development requirements of the South African Council for Educators.
Remuneration: Change the pay structure for teachers. Bursaries alone will not attract enough top-achieving candidates into teaching. The flat wage gradient is a deterrent for highly skilled people. Teacher salaries need to be competitive in comparison to other parts of the public sector. The wage structure should recognise qualifications, experience and the scarcity of skills in specific subjects or geographic areas.
