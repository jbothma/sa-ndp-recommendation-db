Improve relationships between education institutions and employers. SETAs have a crucial role in building relationships between education institutions and the employers.
Resolve the role ofthe skills development levy. The SETAs have a surplus of about R3 billion while other bodies, such as colleges and universities, are financially constrained.
Clarify the mission, purpose and mode of operation of the SETAs. The current system largely excludes public providers (further education and training colleges and universities) from providing training funded by SETAs and the National Skills Fund. A related issue is whether SETA funds can be used to fund new and potential employees or whether they are solely for the currently employed in levyâ€”paying firms. The focus on existing employees makes it harder to build a strong relationship between SETAs and colleges and universities, which would be best placed to train potential employees.
Social partners at the National Economic and Labour Development Council (NEDIJAC) need to debate whether the government, as a large employer, should contribute to the skills levy. Private sector firms and SETAs should take national priorities into account when planning and funding training initiatives.
