To increase the output of professionals, all parts of the education system have to perform well. This is why the Commission has identiﬁed improving the quality of education outcomes throughout the education system as one ofthe highest priorities.
Universities must: Deﬁne their niches to enhance their abilityto contribute to national objectives
Universities must: Provide a diversity of programme offerings to learners
Universities must: Develop capacity to provide quality undergraduateteaching
Universities must: Some must develop the capacity for cutting-edge research training
Universities must: Provide for ﬂexibility and innovation throughoutthe system.
Building an expanded, differentiated university system requires that other post-school institutions function optimally. If the college sector functions optimally, the pressure on universities to offer lower level diplomas and certiﬁcates will be reduced. This will allow universities to focus on their niche.
