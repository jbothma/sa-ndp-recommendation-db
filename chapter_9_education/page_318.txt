Teacher development should include training on curriculum pacing and the subject content that teachers find difficult to teach. Given the large numbers ofteachers, ICT should be used as one of the ways of delivering teacher development.
Different stakeholders should collaborate under a single national initiative to pool resources. Many international donors, private companies, corporate foundations, charitable organisations, NGOs, faith—based organisations and individuals have initiatives under way or are willing to be part ofa national initiative. The national initiative should provide a framework that gives direction to these individual efforts.
Work with communities to address socioeconomic factors like nutrition and safety that impact on learning.
The national initiative should be under the auspices ofthe Department of Basic Education, but draw on expertise in institutions that are already working on school improvement as well as those that have the potential to make a contribution.
The initiative should be piloted in a sample of schools and expanded over time. Interventions should be inversely proportional to school performance. Schools performing well will not be expected to do tasks designed for poorly performing schools. And schools with the lowest performance will receive the closest attention.
The goal is to have a post—school system that provides quality—learning opportunities to young people, adults who want to change careers or upgrade skills, people who have left school before completing their secondary education and unemployed people who wish to start a career. Post—school institutions should provide programmes and services that meet the range of needs.
Vision for the post-school system: The Commission is in agreement with the vision for South Africa's post—school system set out in the Green Paper for Post—School Education and T‘aining (DHET, ZOIZ). The Green Paper promotes higher education as an expanded, effective, coherent and integrated system. Higher education institutions should be supported by effective regulatory and advisory institutions.
The Commission would add to DHET’s vision the need to build national institutions for science, technology and innovation to develop intellectual capital and spur economic growth and development. This system needs to be supported by effective governance and funding mechanisms to promote coordination and collaboration.
