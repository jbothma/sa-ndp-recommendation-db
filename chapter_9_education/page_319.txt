South Africa needs a post-school system that provides a range of accessible options for younger and older people. The system should be capable of adapting to changes in technology, industry, population dynamics and global trends. Accelerating economic growth requires science, technology, vocational and technical skills, and they need to be produced quickly. To promote lifelong learning, post-school institutions should accept students who are academically less prepared and provide them with targeted support.
