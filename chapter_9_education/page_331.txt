 

capabilities, interests, and resources of different
stakeholders. A framework to coordinate the
production of knowledge and guide the investment

ofpublic funds should support such partnerships.

The framework should include strategies and
incentives to attract businesses to develop industry
clusters designed to increase competitiveness and
wealth. These clusters contribute to the

development of science and technology capacity.

CONCLUSION
The decisions we make today will determine the
labour market prospects of graduates in 2030. We

estimate that South Africa will have more than IO

million university graduates and there will be
roughly 400 000 new graduates each year.
Although this will represent a 300 percent increase
over a 30-year period, the country needs other
skills, which are provided through non-degree
programmes. Our education and training

institutions must deliver programmes of the highest

quality.

The proposed interventions in early childhood
development, basic and post school education are
designed to ensure that learning outcomes
improve. The challenges we face require everyone

to be an active participant.
