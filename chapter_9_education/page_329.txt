Overall, South Africa’s global competitiveness needs to be improved, and the system of innovation has a key role to play. It is the principal tool for creating new knowledge, applying knowledge in production processes, and disseminating knowledge through teaching and research collaboration.
The nature of how and where research gets done has changed radically. There are multiple sites of research and knowledge production, which are partly orwholly separated from higher education: in industrial laboratories, government departments, corporate research units, parastatals, statutory research councils and NGOs, or through collaboration between these organisations. It is essential that all these sites of research and innovation are coordinated and function coherently to take advantage of new modes of knowledge production, economies of scale and opportunities presented by working across disciplines.
Create a common overarching framework to address pressing challenges in the national system of innovation, involving the higher and further education system, state—owned enterprises and private industries. The system needs to function in a coherent and coordinated manner with broad common objectives aligned to national priorities. Special consideration should also be given to dedicated programmes in water, power, marine, space and software engineering, in which South Africa has both comparative and competitive advantages. Companies that focus on such programmes should provide internship programmes for experiential learning, specifically in manufacturing and services.
