unemployment rate to 6 percent by 2030.
Education, training and innovation are critical to the

attainment ofthese goals.

Higher levels of education, skills, research and
innovation capacity are also required for:

0 â€˜he transition to a low carbon economy and

meetingthe greenhouse gas emission targets

 

0

ackling health challenges

0

Developing new and utilising existing
technologies
0 Taking advantage ofthe opportunities that arise

from economic growth.

South Africa needs engineering skills to deliver the
massive infrastructure programme announced in

the 20 I 2 State ofthe Nation address. The country

also needs enough doctors, nurses and health
professionals in different occupational classes to
deliver quality healthcare. Critically, the pool of
researchers needs to expand and their productivity
needs to increase significantly. Innovators are going
to play a critical role in creating new products and
new ways of producing existing products cheaply
and more efficiently, including the delivery of public

services.

Building national capabilities requires quality early
childhood development, schooling, college,
university and adult education and training
programmes. Research institutions and the national
science and innovation system must be coordinated

and collaborative.

 

EARLY CHILDHOOD

The benefits of intervening early in the lives of

children include:
0 Better school enrolment rates, retention
and academic performance
0 Higher rates ofhigh school completion

0 Lower levels ofantisocial behaviour

0 Higherearnings
0 Better adult health and longevity.

Improving early nutrition has been shown to

increase school attainment by up to one grade

 

and adult earnings by up to 40 percent. Early
childhood development is critical for children

to reach theirfull potential.
