Proposals to improve human capacity: Human capacity weaknesses are pronounced in teaching, management and district support structures. Over the next l8 years, the following actions will need to be given attention. Some of the actions will be short to medium-term and others will be mediumto long-tem'1.
Produce more and better qualiﬁed teachers: The number of teachers produced each year has increased noticeably, but there are still shortages of teachers for certain subjects and age-groups. Subjects with teacher shortages include languages, mathematics, science, technology and the arts. The shortages are compounded bythe factthatteachers who specialise in these subjects are not always assigned to teach them. There are shortages in the foundation phase and early childhood development. Geographically, shortages are acute in township and rural schools.
One of the main reasons South Africa needs more teachers is to reduce class sizes. Class sizes impact on learner performance. Small classes allow teachers to give more attention to individual learners. In South Africa, for everyteacher there are 33 learners, compared to Botswana where the ratio is |:22, which is one of the lowest teacher/learner ratios in the world. The Department of Basic Education estimates that to achieve the same ratio as Botswana, the public sector has to employ l 60 000 more teachers.
South Africa needs to improve the quality of teacher training, and recruit higher calibre candidates. The Integrated Strategic P/ann/ngr Framework for Teacher Education and Deve/opment in South Aﬂ7'ca 20/ /—2025, provides a useful framework. It needs to be strengthened and there should be incentives to ensure it is implemented effectively.
In the short to medium term, recruit foreign teachers in the areas of critical shortages and grant seven-year working permits to foreign students graduating in South African universities.
Explore non-conventional approaches to attracting and preparing teachers, such as professionals from other areas entering teaching (second-career professionals), on the job training, and fast-track entry systems for experienced professionals.
Create an institutional environment that allows educators in private schools to move back to the state system.
The availability of teachers in all subjects in all schools requires Expanding training capacity; Investigating new ways of attracting teachers; Removing entry difﬁculties for teachers who; have left the profession, foreign teachers, and professionals from other sectors.
