The public signing of an agreement represents an important symbolic commitment by leadership and a public statement of what is important. This should not be a once-off event. Leaders must engage with each other on a continuous basis and repeatedly reafÔ¨Årm theircommitmentto the pact.
Build consensus on the education pact. The pact must be meaningful to all education stakeholders and to all South Africans.
Monitor the pact at the school level. Provide the school community with regular information so that local solutions can be found.
The Commission is proposing a painstaking process of mobilisation and continued engagementwith the education pact. All political leaders, inside and outside of parliament, in provincial legislatures and councils, should commit to the education pact and use it when they do their constituency work. Leaders of sports and faith-based organisations, unions, NGOs, corporations, cooperatives, student organisations, governing bodies, traditional leaders and traditional healers should discuss the pact and address obstacles to implementation.
The importance of education to the future of South Africa demands a non-partisan approach. South Africans should agree that differences and grievances should never be allowed to disrupt education.
Drawing on the existing consensus on the need to work together, the Commission proposes a national initiative involving all stakeholders to drive efforts to improve learning outcomes in schools, starting with the worst performers. The focus should be on schools and districts and address weaknesses in teaching, management, administrative support and accountability.
Use strategies that compensate for weaknesses in schools and district
Provide intervention tools that do not require high levels of capacity
Help build capacity.
Ensure that districts have the capacity to support curriculum delivery. Each district should have a team that ensures that each school has the required material and the knowledge and skillsto use it. Districts should help to develop the leadership and management capacity of principals and heads of departments. At a minimum, this development should cover training in the key responsibilities of principals and members of school senior managementteams.
